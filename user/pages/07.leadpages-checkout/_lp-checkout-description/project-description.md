Leadpages is a SaaS platform designed to help marketers and business owners generate sales leads online using landing pages. While lead generation is a great way to build a list of potential customers, many of Leadpages’ users aspired to achieve more with their landing pages—they wanted to build pages that could directly generate revenue. 

As the primary designer on Leadpages’ landing page builder, I was tasked with designing a Checkout experience that would empower users to sell their products and services online.
