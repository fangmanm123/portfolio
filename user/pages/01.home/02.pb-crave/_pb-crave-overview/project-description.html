<p>Targeted toward health conscious college students and mothers with children under the age of eighteen, PB Crave adds a unique twist to a timeless classic with their four unique flavors of honey-sweetened peanut butter. After a successful trial run in online sales using a cost-effective out-of-the-box e-commerce platform to test the waters, PB Crave decided it was time to get serious about digital presence by partnering with MVP Marketing + Design to build a new state-of-the-art e-commerce website. </p>

<p>Tasked as lead designer on the project, my objective was to design a website that would increase online sales by simplifying the online purchasing process, and elevate the company&#8217;s digital presence. </p>
