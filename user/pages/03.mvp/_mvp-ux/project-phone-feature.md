One key component to building a meaningful experience online is to understanding the audience it's intended to reach. I started this project by developing a brief persona for each of the predefined segments to gain a better understanding of who these people where. Utilizing this work, I then designed a series of wireframes to plan the architecture and content flow for the site.
