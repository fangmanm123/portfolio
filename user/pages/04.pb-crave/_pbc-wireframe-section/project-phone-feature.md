With a sitemap and list of requirements in hand, I put pen to paper sketching out low-fidelity wireframes. My focus during this phase was to create a clear flow of content from page to page that would offer users a superior experience. To more accurately represent the content structure developed through the sketches, I transformed them into high-fidelity wireframes and connected them together using InVision.
