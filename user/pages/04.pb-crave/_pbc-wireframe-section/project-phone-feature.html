<p>Using a collaboratively built sitemap and a list of requirements as my jumping off point, I put pen to paper sketching out low-fidelity wireframes that would demonstrate the initial page-level content structure and user flow for the site. After the foundation was laid through the sketches, I moved to high-fidelity wireframes to illustrate how each page would be laid out and the content would flow throughout the site.</p>
