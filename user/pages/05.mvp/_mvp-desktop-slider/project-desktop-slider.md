The design of this website would be the first real-world implementation of MVP's newly refreshed brand image. With style guide in hand, I set out to develop a visual design system that offered a clean, modern aesthetic while staying true to the company's guidelines. I employed the use of bright colors and strong lines and created ample room for photography to help bring the agency's personality into the site.
