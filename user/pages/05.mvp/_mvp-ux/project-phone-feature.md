I started this project by developing a brief <a href="mvp/mvp-personas.pdf" target="_blank">persona</a> for each of the predefined audience groups to gain a better understanding of what they might be looking for when visiting MVP's website. Utilizing this work, I designed a series of wireframes to lay out the architecture and articulate how users move through the site.
