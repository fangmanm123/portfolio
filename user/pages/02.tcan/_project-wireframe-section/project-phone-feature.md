Using pen and paper, I started exploring layout options. Considering the single-page approach, special attention was given to the content hierarchy to ensure the flow from section to section felt natural. Once the sketches started coming together I transitioned to the computer, prototyping the work using Bourbon, Neat, Bitters, and Refills to help expedite the process.
