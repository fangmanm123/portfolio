<p>While large screens provide ample space to tell your brand&#8217;s story however you wish, smaller devices force you to focus only on what&#8217;s truly important. Hiding non-essential content on smaller screens, I was able to keep the site focused around Caliper&#8217;s core messaging. Other techniques, such as progressive disclosure were employed to provide users information as they need it instead of all at once.</p>
