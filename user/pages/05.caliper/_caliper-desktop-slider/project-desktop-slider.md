One common trait between the various audience segments that Caliper is targeting is that they are all business professionals looking for help in one way or another. Creating a clean, professional aesthetic for the site was a must. Strong typography, a conservative use of color, and ample white space help contribute to a look and feel that instills trust in the Caliper brand.
