<p>Caliper is seasoned a talent management company that specializes in helping business with talent management, leadership development, succession planning, and organization change. While they offer their clients some of the most cutting-edge talent management solutions, their 3-year-old website framed them as a company playing catch up.</p>

<p>With the redesign, Caliper hoped to accomplish several things. The principal focus was to increase site engagement by improving the content hierarchy, flow, and organization. They also hoped the new site would help them overcome the stigma of being perceived as the old player in the game.</p>
