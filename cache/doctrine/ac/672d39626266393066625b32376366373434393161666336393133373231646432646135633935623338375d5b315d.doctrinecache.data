			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			<p><p>PB Crave adds a unique twist to a timeless classic with their four unique flavors of honey-sweetened peanut butter. In an oversaturated market the company needed to find a way to stand out and chose to place their bets online with a new eCommerce website.</p>
<p>One of the primary goals of the redesign was to simplify the online purchasing experience in efforts to increase sales. In addition, PB Crave hoped to boost consumer loyalty and trust by refining their brand image, giving it a more professional aesthetic that could grow with the company.</p></p>
