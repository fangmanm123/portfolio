			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			<p><p>Leadpages is a SaaS platform designed to help marketers and business owners generate sales leads online using landing pages. While lead generation is a great way to build a list of potential customers, many of Leadpages’ users aspired to achieve more with their landing pages—they wanted to build pages that could directly generate revenue. </p>
<p>As the primary designer on Leadpages’ landing page builder, I was tasked with designing a Checkout experience that would empower users to sell their products and services online.</p></p>
