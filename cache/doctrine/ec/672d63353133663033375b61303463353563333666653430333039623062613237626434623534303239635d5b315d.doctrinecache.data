				<h3>Responsive Structure</h3>
				<p><p>One of my primary goals for this project was to create a site design that felt as natural on a 27-inch iMac as it did on an old, beat-up iPhone 4s. To accomplish this goal, I designed sections that would utilize the entirety of a large screen while still adapting easily to smaller devices.</p></p>
