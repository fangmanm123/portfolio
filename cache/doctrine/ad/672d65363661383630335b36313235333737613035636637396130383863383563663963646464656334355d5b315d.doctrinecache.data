				<h3>Project Requirements</h3>
<p>I was pulled into the project after a roadmap had been established and an engineering prototype had been built. Being that things were already in motion, I wasted no time diving in to better understand the short, medium, and long term plan for the Checkout Widget. I then focused on assembling a list of requirements that could impact the end experience. Below are some of the more strenuous requirements I found.</p>
