			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			<p><p>The Twin Cities Alumni Network (TCAN) is a network of local alumni clubs affiliated with select universities from across the country. They work together to facilitate regular networking events between member clubs and other professional organizations. With event attendance at an all time high, the group's co-chairs decided it was time to invest in the club's future by redesign their website.</p>
<p>Since event curation is a key objective for TCAN, one of the primary goals of the redesign was to develop an intuitive, feature-rich event calendar that was easy to use on the go. Another goal was to simplify the overall experience by restructuring the site content into a single page layout.</p></p>
