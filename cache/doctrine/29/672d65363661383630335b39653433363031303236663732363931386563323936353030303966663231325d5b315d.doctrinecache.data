			<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			<p><p>The Connection is a business process outsourcer specializing in call center related services. While in the middle of a website redesign, the company needed a new template for their one-off promotional pages. Tasked as the sole designer, I was given a short list of content requirements and a couple snap shots of the in progress website redesign to work from.</p></p>
