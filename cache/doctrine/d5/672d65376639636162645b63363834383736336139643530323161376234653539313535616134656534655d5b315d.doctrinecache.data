				<h3>Understanding the Product Space</h3>
<p>Once the requirements had been pulled together, I shifted my focused to the product landscape. My goal was to better understand how sales funnels are used in the digital marketing space, uncover common terminology and best practices within the e-commerce and online payment industry, and examine how various competitors were solving this problem for their users.</p>
<p>The research yielded some interesting insights that would help inform language and architecture decisions throughout the project as well as plant seeds for future product enhancements.</p>
