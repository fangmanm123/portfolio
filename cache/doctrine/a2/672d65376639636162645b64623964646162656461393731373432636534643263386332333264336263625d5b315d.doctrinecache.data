				<h3>Project Requirements</h3>
<p>I was pulled into the project after an engineering prototype had been built and a roadmap established. Being that things were already in motion, I wasted no time seeking to understand the short, medium, and long term plan for the Checkout Widget. I then set out to compile a list of requirements that could impact the end experience. A few of the more strenuous project requirements are listed here.</p>
